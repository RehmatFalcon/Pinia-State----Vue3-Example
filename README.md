### Infrastructure

> Vue: The Front End framework used for creating interactive applications [ https://v3.vuejs.org/ ]

> Vuex: The state management library used. [ https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/ ]

> Vite: The build tool used to build/bundle this application [ https://vitejs.dev/ ]

### Note: This project shows the usage of Vuex for state management. However, using state management for list of users/customers is a bad idea. State management should be done for stuffs that the whole site reuqires such as current user, cart items etc.
