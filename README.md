### Infrastructure

> Vue: The Front End framework used for creating interactive applications [ https://v3.vuejs.org/ ]

> Pinia: The state management library used. [ https://pinia.esm.dev/ ]

> Vite: The build tool used to build/bundle this application [ https://vitejs.dev/ ]

> Tailwind: A utility-first CSS framework used to style this project [ https://tailwindcss.com/ ]

> Netlify: Hosting platform used for hosting this app

### Note: This project shows the usage of Pinia for state management. However, using state management for list of users/customers is a bad idea. State management should be done for stuffs that the whole site requires such as current user, cart items etc.

Using state management library for these stuffs might be overkill. It can make your application much more complicated.
